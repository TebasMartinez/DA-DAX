# DAX Dashboard & Insights: Exploring Market Performance and Economic Indicators

The objective of this project is to explore company and industry stock market data (close prices, returns, volumes) for companies that are part of the DAX and their correlations with macroeconomic and social indicators such  as exchange rates (EUR to USD and EUR to GBP), ECB interest rates, and unemployment rates in Germany.

## Questions
- How do ECB interest rates, exchange rates, and unemployment affect DAX performance?
- Which DAX sectors or companies react most strongly to macroeconomic changes?
- Can we predict DAX returns from macro variables and exchange rate movements?

## Methodology
### Data Retrieval
- List of companies in the DAX as of 22 September 2025 web scraped from [Wikipedia](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/DAX).
- Prices retrieved from Yahoo! Finance's API using the [yfinance Python library](https://pypi.org/project/yfinance/).
- Macroeconomic indicators:
  - Exchange rates (EUR/USD and EUR/GBP) and ECB interest rates from [Deutsche Bundesbank](https://www.bundesbank.de/en/statistics/time-series-databases).
  - Unemployment rates from [Bundesagentur f√ºr Arbeit](https://statistik.arbeitsagentur.de/DE/Navigation/Statistiken/Interaktive-Statistiken/Zeitreihen/Lange-Zeitreihen-Nav.html?Fachstatistik%3Dalo%26DR_Gebietsstruktur%3Dd%26Gebiete_Region%3DDeutschland%26DR_Region%3Dd%26DR_Region_d%3Dd%26DR_RK%3Dinsg%26mapHadSelection%3Dfalse%26toggleswitch_saison%3D0).

#### Roadblocks
- Limits in free-tier plans of different news APIs ([NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org/), [mediastack](https://mediastack.com/), [FMP](https://site.financialmodelingprep.com/)), impeding the extraction of sentiment-related data.

### Dashboard creation
Using the Streamlit library, I created a dashboard to allow for exploration of the data per company or industry, and their correlations with macroeconomic and social indicators.

### Exploratory Data Analysis
- Univariate EDA performed in a Jupyter Notebook.
- Bivariate EDA through exploration of the created dashboard.
